# Task Manager App

A React-based task management application with authentication, demonstrating common architectural issues in AI-generated code.

## 🚨 **Warning: This is a Demo of Problematic Code**

This application was generated using AI tools (Cursor/Copilot) and serves as an example of **what not to do** in production applications. While it functions correctly, it contains multiple architectural flaws that make it fragile, untestable, and unmaintainable.

## 🎯 **What This App Does**

- **Authentication**: Login/logout with mock credentials
- **Task Management**: Add, delete, and toggle task completion
- **Persistence**: Tasks and auth state stored in localStorage
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd task-manager-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Demo Credentials
- **Admin**: `admin` / `password123`
- **User**: `user` / `user123`

## ⚠️ **Critical Architectural Issues**

This codebase demonstrates the "One Mistake That Weakens Every AI-Generated App" - **lack of proper architectural boundaries**. Here are the specific problems:

### 1. **No Prop Boundaries Between Components**
- **Location**: `App.js` (lines 9-22)
- **Issue**: Components accept props without validation or type definitions
- **Impact**: Runtime errors, difficult refactoring, poor developer experience

### 2. **Zero Test Coverage**
- **Location**: `App.test.js` (lines 4-8)
- **Issue**: Only broken template test exists; critical logic untested
- **Impact**: Bugs reach production, no confidence in changes

### 3. **Broken Separation of Concerns**
- **Location**: `Dashboard.js` (lines 32-82), `AuthContext.js` (lines 32-52)
- **Issue**: UI, business logic, and state management tangled together
- **Impact**: Hard to test, debug, and maintain

### 4. **State Tightly Coupled and Improperly Scoped**
- **Location**: `AuthContext.js` (lines 19-71), `Dashboard.js` (lines 7-10)
- **Issue**: Business state mixed with UI state, localStorage hardcoded
- **Impact**: Cannot reuse logic, difficult to scale

### 5. **No Path for Reusability or Expansion**
- **Location**: `AuthContext.js` (lines 6-9, 32-52), `Dashboard.js` (lines 46-66)
- **Issue**: Hardcoded logic, no service layer, no abstraction
- **Impact**: Adding features requires rewriting code

## 🔧 **Available Scripts**

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner (⚠️ **Warning**: Tests are broken and incomplete)

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production (⚠️ **Warning**: Contains architectural issues)

### `npm run eject`
Ejects from Create React App (⚠️ **Warning**: One-way operation)

## 🧪 **Testing Issues**

The current test suite is inadequate:
- Only one broken smoke test exists
- No unit tests for business logic
- No integration tests for user flows
- No error boundary tests

## 🚫 **What NOT to Do (Based on This Code)**

1. **Don't mix UI and business logic** in the same component
2. **Don't hardcode data** in components or contexts
3. **Don't skip prop validation** and type definitions
4. **Don't ignore testing** critical application logic
5. **Don't couple state management** directly to UI components

## ✅ **What TO Do Instead**

1. **Create service layers** for business logic
2. **Use custom hooks** for reusable state logic
3. **Implement proper prop validation** with TypeScript or PropTypes
4. **Write comprehensive tests** for all critical paths
5. **Separate concerns** with clear architectural boundaries

## ⚡ **Performance Notes**

- No code splitting implemented
- No lazy loading
- No memoization for expensive operations
- localStorage operations on every state change

## 🔒 **Security Notes**

- Mock authentication only
- No input sanitization
- No CSRF protection
- Not suitable for production use
